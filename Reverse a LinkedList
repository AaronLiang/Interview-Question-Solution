What is the reverse of null (the empty list)? null.
What is the reverse of a one element list? the element.
What is the reverse of an n element list? the reverse of the second element on followed by the first element.
--------------------------------------------
//recursion
public ListNode Reverse(ListNode list)
{
    if (list == null) return null; // first question

    if (list.next == null) return list; // second question

    // third question - in Lisp this is easy, but we don't have cons
    // so we grab the second element (which will be the last after we reverse it)

    ListNode secondElem = list.next;

    // bug fix - need to unlink list from the rest or you will get a cycle
    list.next = null;

    // then we reverse everything from the second element on
    ListNode reverseRest = Reverse(secondElem);

    // then we join the two lists
    secondElem.Next = list;

    return reverseRest;
}
-----------------------------------------------------
//while loop
public ListNode reverse(ListNode head){
    if(head == null) return null;
    if(head.next == null) return head;
    
    ListNode l = null;// node which has been reversed;
    ListNode c = head;// current node which need to reverse;
    ListNode r = c.next;// r keep the one after current;
    
    while(r != null){
        c.next = l;
        l = c;
        c = r;
        r = c.next;
    }
    c.next = l; //bug here, after while loop , shold point last to left;
    return c;
}
