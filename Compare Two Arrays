You are given two arrays find if they are equal 

I gave solution using Hash table and he was fine with it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMZ 10

Input:  two arrays
Output: boolean stating their equality

Assumptions:
- Equal in length
- Equal in values
  - What if values are custom classes?
    - Trust that their equality function works?
    - Are the objects comparable?
    
Braintorm:
1.
- If length is equal
  - Sort both arrays, then compare each element

O(nlogn) time, O(1) space

2.
- Add first array to hashMap
- Check if each element from 2nd array exists in hashMap, if it does, remove from hashMap
- If hashMap is empty at the end, arrays are equal

O(n) time, O(n) space

public boolean areEqual(T[] a, T[] b) {
    if(a.length != b.length)
        return false;
    
    if(!a.getClass().equals(b.getClass())
        return false;
    
    Arrays.sort(a /* May need to pass comparator */);
    Arrays.sort(b /* May need to pass comparator */);
         
    for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if(!a[i].equals(b[i]))
            return false;
        //Can use a[i].compareTo(b[i]) != 0 if that's implemented
        //Or whichever equality/comparison function is appropriate
    }
    return true;
}
