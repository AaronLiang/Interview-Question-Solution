Find the longest common subsequence of two string






-----------------------------------------------------------------
Let string 1 is A[nx1] and string 2 is B[mx1]
Now take M[n+1,m+1];
for i = 0 to n
   M[i][0] = 0;
for j = 0 to m
   M[0][j] = 0;
for i = 1 to n
    for j  = 1 to m
         if A[i-1] = B[j-1]
             M[i][j] = 1 + M[i-1][j-1];
         else
             M[i][j] = Max(M[i-1][j],M[i][j-1])
output M[n][m];
